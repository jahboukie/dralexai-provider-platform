# üîí Dr. Alex AI - Enterprise Security & Compliance Documentation

## üè• Healthcare-First Security Architecture

Dr. Alex AI is built with healthcare compliance at its core, implementing military-grade security measures specifically designed for protecting sensitive patient health information (PHI).

## üõ°Ô∏è Zero-Knowledge Proof Encryption

### Core Principles
- **Client-Side Encryption**: All patient data is encrypted on the provider's device before transmission
- **Server-Blind Architecture**: Our servers cannot decrypt patient data without the provider's private key
- **Cryptographic Proofs**: Data integrity verification without content exposure
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Rotating encryption keys ensure past communications remain secure

### Technical Implementation
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Perform computations on encrypted data without decryption
- **Multi-Party Computation**: Collaborative analytics without data sharing
- **Secure Enclaves**: Hardware-based trusted execution environments
- **Key Management**: HSM-backed key generation and rotation
